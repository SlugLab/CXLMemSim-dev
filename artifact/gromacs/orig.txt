Initialising inter-atomic distances...

WARNING: Masses and atomic (Van der Waals) radii will be guessed
         based on residue and atom names, since they could not be
         definitively assigned from the information in your input
         files. These guessed numbers might deviate from the mass
         and radius of the atom type. Please check the output
         files if necessary. Note, that this functionality may
         be removed in a future GROMACS version. Please, consider
         using another file format for your input.

NOTE: From version 5.0 gmx solvate uses the Van der Waals radii
from the source below. This means the results may be different
compared to previous GROMACS versions.

Generating solvent configuration
Will generate new solvent configuration of 5x5x5 boxes
Solvent box contains 69699 atoms in 23233 residues
Removed 7791 solvent atoms due to solvent-solvent overlap
Removed 4365 solvent atoms due to solute-solvent overlap
Sorting configuration
Found 1 molecule type:
    SOL (   3 atoms): 19181 residues
Generated solvent containing 57543 atoms in 19181 residues
Writing generated configuration to 5pep-solv.gro

Back Off! I just backed up 5pep-solv.gro to ./#5pep-solv.gro.1#

Output configuration contains 62225 atoms in 19507 residues
Volume                 :     627.119 (nm^3)
Density                :     1012.07 (g/l)
Number of solvent molecules:  19181

Processing topology
Adding line for 19181 solvent molecules with resname (SOL) to topology file (topol.top)

Back Off! I just backed up topol.top to ./#topol.top.3#
